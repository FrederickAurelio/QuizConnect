Kerjaan Host Page

Chatgpt has table design for game records.

GOT A WRONG LOGIC HERE.....
THE URL ROUTE MUSE BE host/ GAME CODE not the quiz ID

so when USER CLICK HOST BUTTON WE MUTATE AND CREATE A HOST ON REDIS
AFTER THAT REDIRECT USER TO HOST LOBBY/HOST PAGE...

AFTER THAT WE FETCH THE DATA, WHICH IS REDIS DATA, WITH ALL THE HOST DATA
FROM QUIZ METADATA.. GAME SETTINGS and GAME CODE (GAME STATUS: FINISH, WAITING, RUNNING).., AND PLAYER JOINED DATA 

NEED TO RECONFIGURE THE BACKEND METADATA AND IN FRONTEND NOT FETCH THAT ROUTE

ALSO IN THE PAGE THERE ARE SETTINGS STATE WHICH GET A DEFAULT FROM REDIS
AFTER THAT A USEEFFECT TO WEBSOCKET TO UPDATE THE SETTING STATE WHEN HOST UPDATE
THE HOST ARE BLOCKING THE USEEFFECT SO THE STATE WAS A LOCAL STATE...
